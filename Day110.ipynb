        "\n",
        "TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by the **Google Brain** team for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. It uses a system of **Tensors** (multi-dimensional arrays) that flow through a **Graph** of operations, allowing you to build and train neural networks efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Flexibility:** Allows you to build models using high-level abstractions or dive deep into custom mathematical operations.\n",
        "* **Scalability:** You can run your code on a single CPU, multiple GPUs, or even Google’s custom **TPUs** (Tensor Processing Units).\n",
        "* **High-Level APIs (Keras):** Makes building models as simple as stacking layers (e.g., `layers.Dense`).\n",
        "* **TensorBoard:** A powerful visualization tool used to track metrics like loss and accuracy, or to visualize the model graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. TensorFlow Components\n",
        "\n",

        "| **TF Lite** | A lightweight solution for deploying models on **mobile devices** and IoT/embedded systems. |\n",
